w-scan2 (1.0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [1.0.6] 2019-12-13
  * - re-enable VHF band III in Europe

  * [1.0.5] 2019-03-14
  * - added new arguments for isdb-tb tuners (tested with MyGica S2870 & PlayTV USB Hybrid PV-B308U)

  * [1.0.4] 2018-10-23
  *  - replace country-based DVB-T skipping with new command line arguments:
  *  -ft1 and -ft2 to scan only DVB-T or DVB-T2, respectively

  * [1.0.3] 2018-10-13, contributed by DF5EQ
  * - DVB-T scanning is skipped for AT, DE and CO
  * - DVB_T2 scanning is no longer skipped at all, but a mechanism is in place for
  *   doing it by country
  * - PLP ID 1 is enabled for AT
  * - some manual code formatting in scan.c, where the line length limits of the
  *   formatting script rendered the code hard to read

  * [1.0.2] 2018-06-17
  *  - move the source files in a "src" subdirectory
  *  - apply some of the Linux kernel coding style indentation using the Lindent
  *    script from the kernel tree
  *  - merge w_scan-20170107

  * [1.0.1] 2017-03-29
  *  - fix a corner case where a pair of transponders kept adding each other to
  *    the scanning loop, without ending up in any list we use for avoiding them
  *    in the future. The end result was an endless loop. Thanks
  *    https://github.com/mfyorp for reporting the bug and testing the fix.

  * [1.0.0] 2016-10-14
  *  - project forked from https://www.gen2vdr.de/wirbel/w_scan/index2.html and renamed w_scan2
  *  - keep duplicate transponders by default because a stronger transponder with
  *    the same ID might have a higher frequency and be discarded simply because
  *    it's scanned later. Also don't replace the current transponder with an
  *    advertised one by default. The latter may have a lower signal strength.
  *    More details here:
  *    https://stefantalpalaru.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/scan-all-the-things/ .
  *    The old behaviour can be enabled with -d (--delete-duplicate-transponders).
  *  - all files are now ASCII or UTF-8 and have Unix line terminators
  *  - refactored the autotools files
